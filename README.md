# Delphi-Hellman Key Exchange

The Delphi-Hellman Key Exchange is a cryptographic protocol that enables two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel. This project implements the Delphi-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm using three files and requires the use of Visual Studio Code as the development environment.

## Getting Started

To run the code successfully, follow these steps:

1. Start by running the server file.
2. Next, run the client file.
3. Finally, run the client2 file.

The server will wait for clients to connect. Once the first client connects, the server will start writing "1," indicating that it is waiting for the second client. Please note that this is a temporary implementation and serves as a placeholder.

Once the clients successfully connect, you can send messages from the client side. These messages will be encrypted and displayed on the server. To disconnect from the server, simply close the program or send the message "bye" in the chat.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Visual Studio Code
