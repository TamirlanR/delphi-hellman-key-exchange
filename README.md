# delphi-hellman-key-exchange
  a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to obtain a shared secret key using an unprotected communication channel
This project works on one computer by running and using 3 files at the same time, Visual Studio Code helps with this.

To run the code, you first need to run the server file, after which you need to run the client file and at the end the client2 file

  When the server starts up, it waits for clients to connect, after connecting the first client, it starts writing 1, waiting for 2 clients, this is something like a stub, I didnâ€™t know how else to do it.


  After a successful connection, you can send messages from the client side, which will then be encrypted, and the encrypted messages will be shown on the server),
to disconnect from the server, you can either simply close the program or write in messages:bye
